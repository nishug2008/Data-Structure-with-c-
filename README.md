# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in C++. It is intended for educational purposes and as a reference for developers looking to understand and implement common data structures.

## Overview
This project provides clean, well-documented implementations of various data structures. Each data structure is implemented in its own set of files, with examples and usage guidelines.

## Data structure
Array

Linked List

Stack

Queue

Tree

Graph
## Installation

  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/datastructures-cpp.git
cd datastructures-cpp
```
2. Build the Project
Compile the project using a C++ compiler:
```bash
g++ -o main main.cpp Array.cpp LinkedList.cpp Stack.cpp Queue.cpp BinaryTree.cpp BinarySearchTree.cpp Graph.cpp HashTable.cpp
```
